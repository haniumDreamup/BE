			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Spring Boot Backend Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Spring Boot infrastructure setup into subtasks covering: 1) Core project setup with dependencies, 2) Database and cache configuration, 3) AWS integration, 4) Security and environment configuration, and 5) Docker and deployment setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Spring Boot, MySQL, Redis, AWS) and requires careful configuration for different environments. The complexity comes from integrating these systems cohesively while ensuring proper security and deployment practices. The task is foundational but requires expertise across several domains."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and JPA Entities",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the database schema implementation into logical entity groups: 1) User and Guardian entities, 2) Device and connectivity entities, 3) Content entities (CapturedImages, AnalysisResults), 4) Schedule and notification entities, 5) Activity and medication tracking entities, and 6) Database migration and indexing strategy.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing 10+ complex entities with various relationships, embedded objects, and specialized data types. The complexity is high due to the need for proper cascade rules, validation, indexing strategies, and migration scripts. The entities also need to support advanced patterns like event sourcing and polymorphic types."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Authentication and Authorization System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication system into: 1) JWT token implementation and configuration, 2) User registration and login flows, 3) Role-based authorization and hierarchy, 4) Security hardening (rate limiting, CORS, account lockout), and 5) Password management and OAuth integration.",
			"reasoning": "Security implementations require significant expertise and attention to detail. This task involves JWT token management, complex role hierarchies, multi-factor authentication, and various security hardening techniques. The system must be both secure and usable, with proper handling of edge cases like account lockouts and password resets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Image Processing and Storage Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the image processing pipeline into: 1) Image upload and validation service, 2) Image preprocessing and optimization, 3) S3 storage integration with lifecycle management, and 4) Image retrieval and delivery optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines file handling, image processing, cloud storage, and optimization techniques. The complexity comes from handling large binary data efficiently, implementing proper preprocessing, and ensuring the system works reliably under various network conditions. The S3 integration and lifecycle management add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate LLM for Situational Analysis",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM integration into: 1) OpenAI client service with error handling, 2) Prompt engineering for BIF-appropriate responses, 3) Response processing and validation, 4) Caching and fallback mechanisms, 5) Cost optimization and tracking, and 6) A/B testing framework for prompt effectiveness.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex AI integration with specialized prompt engineering for vulnerable users. The complexity is high due to the need for sophisticated prompt design, fallback mechanisms, response validation, and cost optimization. The system must be reliable even when the AI service fails and must provide appropriate, safe responses for BIF users."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Android Mobile Application Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Android app foundation into: 1) Project setup with accessibility-focused architecture, 2) Core UI components and navigation system, 3) Device connectivity and background services, 4) Offline data management, and 5) Accessibility features and input methods (voice, haptic).",
			"reasoning": "Building an accessible mobile application requires specialized knowledge of both Android development and accessibility best practices. The complexity comes from implementing a simplified yet functional UI, reliable device connectivity, background services, and multiple input methods. The app must work reliably offline and provide consistent accessibility features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Schedule and Reminder System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the scheduling system into: 1) Schedule management APIs and data models, 2) Notification engine with priority handling, 3) Pattern learning and optimization algorithms, 4) Medication tracking and management, and 5) Contextual reminder delivery system.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines scheduling algorithms, notification systems, and machine learning components. The complexity is high due to the need for reliable scheduling, intelligent pattern recognition, and context-aware notifications. The medication tracking features add additional complexity with visual recognition and dosage confirmation workflows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Safety and Emergency Features",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the safety system into: 1) Fall detection algorithm and sensor fusion, 2) Emergency response and alert system, 3) Geofencing and location monitoring, 4) Wandering detection and navigation assistance, 5) SOS functionality and emergency recording, and 6) Emergency contact management.",
			"reasoning": "This task has the highest complexity due to its critical safety implications and technical challenges. It combines sensor data processing, machine learning for pattern detection, real-time alerting, geolocation services, and emergency protocols. The system must be extremely reliable with minimal false positives/negatives as user safety depends on it."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Social Interaction Support System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the social interaction system into: 1) Emotion recognition integration, 2) Conversation assistance and prompting, 3) Social situation interpretation, 4) Conflict detection and de-escalation, and 5) Privacy controls and data management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex AI integration for emotion recognition and social cue interpretation. The complexity is high due to the nuanced nature of social interactions, the need for real-time processing, and the importance of privacy and consent. The system must provide helpful guidance while respecting privacy and cultural differences."
