# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Device Management Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system for managing wearable devices and their connectivity
# Details:
Develop device registration and pairing APIs, implement device health monitoring (battery, connectivity), create firmware update distribution system, develop device-specific settings management, implement multi-device support per user

# Test Strategy:
Test device pairing flow, verify battery monitoring accuracy, test firmware update process, validate multi-device handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Device Entity Model and Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive data models for device management including device registration, pairing information, and device health metrics
### Details:
Create Device entity with fields: id, userId, deviceType, serialNumber, firmwareVersion, pairingCode, status, lastSeenAt, createdAt, updatedAt. Create DeviceHealth entity for battery level, connectivity status, signal strength. Create DevicePairing entity for pairing tokens and authentication. Add proper indexes for userId and serialNumber lookups. Implement repository interfaces with JPA specifications for complex queries

## 2. Implement Device Registration and Pairing APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Develop REST endpoints for device registration, pairing validation, and secure device-user association
### Details:
Create DeviceController with endpoints: POST /api/devices/register for initial device registration, POST /api/devices/pair for pairing with verification code, GET /api/devices for listing user devices, DELETE /api/devices/{deviceId} for unpair. Implement pairing flow with time-limited codes, device authentication using JWT tokens, and validation for device type compatibility. Add rate limiting for pairing attempts

## 3. Create Device Health Monitoring Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1, 34.2
### Description: Implement real-time monitoring system for device battery levels, connectivity status, and automatic alerts
### Details:
Create DeviceHealthService with scheduled tasks to collect health metrics every 5 minutes. Implement WebSocket endpoint for real-time health updates. Create battery alert thresholds (critical <15%, low <30%). Monitor connectivity with heartbeat mechanism and mark devices offline after 10 minutes of inactivity. Store health history in time-series format for trend analysis. Implement notification triggers for critical battery and connectivity loss

## 4. Develop Firmware Update Distribution System [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1, 34.2
### Description: Build secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware update mechanism with version management and rollback capabilities
### Details:
Create FirmwareService to manage firmware versions with metadata (version, changelog, device compatibility, checksum). Implement staged rollout system with percentage-based deployment. Create update endpoints: GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/firmware/check for version check, POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/firmware/update to initiate update. Store firmware files in S3 with signed URLs for secure download. Implement update status tracking (downloading, installing, completed, failed) with progress reporting

## 5. Implement Multi-Device Support and Settings Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1, 34.2, 34.3, 34.4
### Description: Enable users to manage multiple devices with individual settings and preferences per device
### Details:
Extend device management to support multiple active devices per user with primary device designation. Create DeviceSettings entity for device-specific configurations (notification preferences, sampling intervals, feature toggles). Implement settings synchronization across devices with conflict resolution. Create device switching mechanism in user sessions. Add device-specific dashboard showing all connected devices with quick actions (locate, settings, unpair). Implement device naming and categorization features
