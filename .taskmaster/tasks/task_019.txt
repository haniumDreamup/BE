# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Location Tracking and Geofencing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create location monitoring system with safe zone management
# Details:
Implement GPS data collection and storage, create geofencing service with configurable safe zones, develop location history tracking with privacy controls, implement intelligent alerts for unusual location patterns, add battery-efficient location sampling algorithms

# Test Strategy:
Test geofence boundary detection accuracy, verify location privacy settings, test battery consumption optimization, validate alert triggering logic

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Location Entity and Repository Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for location tracking with JPA entities and Spring Data repositories
### Details:
Create Location entity with fields: id, userId, deviceId, latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude, speed, heading, timestamp, batteryLevel, isInsideSafeZone. Add indexes on userId, deviceId, and timestamp for query performance. Create LocationRepository with custom queries for finding locations by user and time range. Implement LocationHistory entity for aggregated historical data with privacy-aware retention policies.

## 2. Implement Geofencing Service with Safe Zone Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Build core geofencing logic for defining, storing, and checking safe zones with configurable boundaries
### Details:
Create SafeZone entity with fields: id, userId, name, centerLatitude, centerLongitude, radius, isActive, schedule. Implement GeofencingService with methods: createSafeZone(), updateSafeZone(), checkLocationInZone(), calculateDistance(). Use Haversine formula for distance calculations. Support multiple zone types (circular, polygonal). Store zones in Redis for fast lookup. Implement zone overlap detection and priority handling.

## 3. Develop Battery-Efficient Location Sampling Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Implement adaptive location sampling algorithms that balance accuracy with battery conservation
### Details:
Create LocationSamplingService with adaptive sampling rates based on: movement patterns (stationary vs moving), battery level, time of day, proximity to safe zones. Implement sampling strategies: HIGH_ACCURACY (5s), BALANCED (30s), POWER_SAVE (2min). Use Android's FusedLocationProvider equivalent logic. Cache last known location. Implement motion detection to trigger sampling changes. Add configuration for minimum accuracy threshold.

## 4. Build Intelligent Alert System for Location Anomalies [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Create smart alerting system that detects unusual location patterns and notifies guardians appropriately
### Details:
Implement LocationAlertService with pattern detection: unexpected zone exit, prolonged stationary periods, route deviation, no location updates. Create alert rules engine with configurable thresholds. Implement ML-based anomaly detection using historical patterns. Add alert fatigue prevention with smart grouping. Create priority levels: CRITICAL (immediate), WARNING (5min delay), INFO (digest). Store alerts in database with delivery tracking.

## 5. Create Location API Endpoints with Privacy Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Develop REST APIs for location tracking with comprehensive privacy and access controls
### Details:
Create LocationController with endpoints: POST /api/locations (receive updates), GET /api/locations/current/{userId}, GET /api/locations/history, POST /api/geofences, GET /api/locations/alerts. Implement privacy filters: location fuzzing for non-guardians, time-based access restrictions, consent verification. Add request validation with @Valid. Implement pagination for history. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates. Include rate limiting to prevent tracking abuse.
