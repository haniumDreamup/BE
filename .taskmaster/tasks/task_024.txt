# Task ID: 24
# Title: Build Notification Service with Multi-channel Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive notification system supporting various delivery methods
# Details:
Implement push notification service for mobile apps, create SMS notification integration for critical alerts, develop in-app notification center, implement notification preferences per user/guardian, create notification templates with simple language

# Test Strategy:
Test notification delivery across all channels, verify delivery confirmation tracking, test notification preference enforcement, validate message simplification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Notification Service Architecture and Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for multi-channel notification service including database schema design for notifications, delivery status tracking, and user preferences
### Details:
Design database tables: notifications (id, user_id, type, title, content, priority, created_at), notification_deliveries (id, notification_id, channel, status, delivered_at, read_at), notification_preferences (user_id, channel, enabled, quiet_hours), notification_templates (id, type, channel, template_content). Create service interfaces for NotificationService, ChannelProvider (with implementations for each channel), and TemplateEngine. Define notification priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and delivery status enum (PENDING, SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED, READ)

## 2. Implement Push Notification Service for Mobile Apps [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create push notification integration using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android/iOS devices with device token management and delivery tracking
### Details:
Implement FCMNotificationChannel class implementing ChannelProvider interface. Add device token management: store FCM tokens in user_devices table (user_id, device_id, token, platform, last_active). Create notification payload builder that formats messages according to BIF requirements (simple language, clear actions). Implement delivery confirmation webhook handler to update notification_deliveries table. Add retry logic for failed deliveries (max 3 attempts with exponential backoff). Configure FCM credentials in application properties

## 3. Develop SMS Notification Integration for Critical Alerts [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement SMS notification channel using AWS SNS or Twilio for critical alerts like emergencies, medication reminders, and guardian notifications
### Details:
Create SMSNotificationChannel implementing ChannelProvider. Define critical notification types enum (EMERGENCY, MEDICATION_DUE, GUARDIAN_ALERT, DEVICE_LOW_BATTERY). Implement message formatting to fit SMS constraints (160 chars) while maintaining clarity. Add phone number validation and formatting for international support. Create cost control mechanisms: daily SMS limits per user, priority-based sending for budget management. Implement delivery status tracking via provider webhooks

## 4. Build In-App Notification Center with Real-time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create in-app notification system with WebSocket support for real-time updates, notification history, and mark-as-read functionality
### Details:
Implement InAppNotificationChannel with WebSocket integration using Spring WebSocket. Create REST endpoints: GET /api/notifications (paginated list), PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read (mark as read), DELETE /api/notifications/{id} (soft delete), GET /api/notifications/unread-count. Add Redis caching for unread counts and recent notifications. Implement notification grouping by type and date for better organization. Create notification bell icon badge update via WebSocket. Add notification history with 30-day retention policy

## 5. Implement User Preference Management and Template System [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2, 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Create comprehensive preference management system allowing users/guardians to control notification channels, quiet hours, and implement template system with simple language
### Details:
Build preference management API: POST /api/users/{id}/notification-preferences, GET /api/users/{id}/notification-preferences. Implement quiet hours logic (check before sending non-critical notifications). Create notification template engine with placeholders: {userName}, {medicationName}, {time}, {guardianName}. Implement language simplification service that converts complex terms to simple alternatives (stored in simplification_dictionary table). Add template versioning for A/B testing effectiveness. Create guardian override capabilities for critical settings. Implement channel fallback logic (if push fails, try SMS for critical alerts)
