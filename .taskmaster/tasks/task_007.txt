# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Schedule and Reminder System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build intelligent scheduling system with pattern learning, medication management, and multi-modal reminder delivery
# Details:
1. Create schedule management REST APIs
2. Implement recurrence patterns with Quartz scheduler
3. Build notification engine with priority queuing:
   - Critical: Medication, emergencies
   - High: Appointments, important tasks
   - Normal: Routine reminders
4. Develop pattern learning algorithm:
   - Analyze completion times
   - Suggest optimal reminder timing
   - Adjust based on user response
5. Create medication tracking features:
   - Visual pill recognition using AI
   - Dosage confirmation workflow
   - Refill prediction algorithm
6. Implement reminder escalation:
   - Initial gentle reminder
   - Follow-up with increased urgency
   - Guardian notification if ignored
7. Build contextual reminder system:
   - Location-based triggers
   - Time-of-day optimization
   - Activity correlation
8. Add voice reminder generation
9. Create reminder templates for common tasks

# Test Strategy:
1. Test scheduler reliability and timing accuracy
2. Verify notification delivery across channels
3. Test pattern learning with simulated data
4. Validate medication tracking accuracy
5. Test escalation workflows
6. Load test with thousands of concurrent schedules

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Schedule Management APIs and Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core scheduling system APIs and data models to manage user schedules, appointments, and recurring events.
### Details:
1. Design and implement Schedule and ScheduleItem entities with JPA annotations
2. Create DTO classes for schedule creation, update, and retrieval
3. Develop REST endpoints for CRUD operations on schedules
4. Implement recurrence pattern logic using Quartz scheduler
5. Create service layer with business logic for schedule management
6. Add validation for schedule conflicts and timing constraints

## 2. Build Notification Engine with Priority Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a robust notification system that can prioritize and deliver reminders based on importance levels.
### Details:
1. Create notification data models with priority levels (Critical, High, Normal)
2. Implement notification queuing system with Redis
3. Develop priority-based delivery algorithms
4. Create notification templates for different types of reminders
5. Implement escalation workflows for unacknowledged critical notifications
6. Add multi-channel delivery support (push, SMS, in-app)

## 3. Implement Pattern Learning and Optimization Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create machine learning components that analyze user behavior and optimize reminder timing and frequency.
### Details:
1. Design data collection system for user response to reminders
2. Implement algorithms to analyze completion times and patterns
3. Create suggestion engine for optimal reminder timing
4. Develop feedback loop for continuous improvement
5. Add user preference weighting to the algorithm
6. Implement A/B testing framework for algorithm validation

## 4. Develop Medication Tracking and Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build features for tracking medications, including visual recognition, dosage confirmation, and reminder scheduling.
### Details:
1. Create medication data models with dosage, frequency, and instructions
2. Implement visual pill recognition using AI integration
3. Develop dosage confirmation workflows with photo verification
4. Create medication inventory tracking and refill reminders
5. Implement medication schedule generation based on prescription data
6. Add emergency contact notification for missed critical medications

## 5. Create Contextual Reminder Delivery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop a system that delivers reminders with appropriate context and in the right format based on user situation and preferences.
### Details:
1. Implement context-aware delivery based on user location and activity
2. Create multi-modal reminder formats (text, audio, visual)
3. Develop adaptive reminder intensity based on user response
4. Implement reminder bundling to prevent notification fatigue
5. Create simplified visual instructions for complex tasks
6. Add confirmation and follow-up mechanisms for important reminders
