# Task ID: 39
# Title: Build Integration Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish comprehensive integration testing infrastructure
# Details:
Set up TestContainers for database testing, implement API integration test suites, create end-to-end test scenarios for critical paths, develop performance testing framework, implement automated regression testing

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage > 80%, test framework reliability, validate performance benchmarks, ensure test isolation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up TestContainers Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure TestContainers framework for Spring Boot integration testing with MySQL and Redis containers
### Details:
Add TestContainers dependencies to build.gradle (testcontainers-bom, mysql, redis modules). Create base test configuration class @TestConfiguration with @DynamicPropertySource to inject container properties. Set up container lifecycle management with @BeforeAll/@AfterAll. Configure containers with production-like settings (MySQL 8.0, Redis latest). Create AbstractIntegrationTest base class that all integration tests will extend.

## 2. Implement API Integration Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Create comprehensive REST API integration tests using MockMvc and TestRestTemplate for all endpoints
### Details:
Create test classes for each controller using @SpringBootTest with WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT. Implement test utilities for JWT token generation and authentication setup. Test all CRUD operations with valid/invalid data. Verify response formats match API conventions (success/error structure). Test authorization scenarios (authenticated, unauthorized, forbidden). Create test data builders using Builder pattern for complex request objects.

## 3. Create End-to-End Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.2
### Description: Develop complete user journey tests for critical application flows including authentication, reminder creation, and emergency features
### Details:
Implement E2E test for user registration → login → create reminder → receive notification flow. Test emergency contact triggering with notification delivery verification. Create medication adherence tracking scenario with schedule validation. Test AI-powered context analysis flow from image upload to guidance generation. Implement data cleanup between scenarios to ensure test isolation. Use @Sql annotations for test data setup.

## 4. Develop Performance Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.2
### Description: Build performance testing infrastructure using JMeter or Gatling to validate system performance under load
### Details:
Set up Gatling with Gradle plugin for load testing. Create performance test scenarios for critical endpoints (auth, reminder operations, AI analysis). Configure load profiles: baseline (10 users), normal (50 users), peak (100+ concurrent users). Implement performance metrics collection (response time, throughput, error rate). Create performance regression detection with threshold alerts. Generate HTML reports with performance trends.

## 5. Implement Automated Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.3, 39.4
### Description: Create automated regression test suite with CI/CD integration and test result reporting
### Details:
Configure test categorization using JUnit tags (@IntegrationTest, @PerformanceTest, @RegressionTest). Set up parallel test execution in Gradle for faster feedback. Implement test result aggregation and reporting with Allure or similar framework. Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution on PR/merge. Configure test coverage reporting with JaCoCo, enforce 80% minimum coverage. Set up test failure notifications via Slack/email.
