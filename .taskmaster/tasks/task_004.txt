# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Image Processing and Storage Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create image upload, storage, and processing system with S3 integration and optimization for low-bandwidth scenarios
# Details:
1. Implement multipart file upload endpoint with size validation
2. Create image preprocessing service:
   - Resize to 720p for analysis
   - JPEG compression for bandwidth optimization
   - EXIF data extraction for location/timestamp
3. Setup S3 bucket structure:
   - Raw images: /users/{userId}/raw/{timestamp}
   - Processed images: /users/{userId}/processed/{timestamp}
   - Lifecycle policies for 90-day retention
4. Implement async processing with Spring @Async
5. Create image metadata extraction service
6. Build thumbnail generation for mobile app display
7. Implement CDN integration for fast image delivery
8. Add virus scanning for uploaded images
9. Create batch upload support for offline sync
10. Implement progressive image loading

# Test Strategy:
1. Test file upload with various formats and sizes
2. Verify S3 upload and retrieval operations
3. Test image processing quality and performance
4. Measure upload times under different network conditions
5. Test concurrent upload handling
6. Verify storage lifecycle policies

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Image Upload and Validation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a secure and reliable service for handling image uploads with proper validation and error handling
### Details:
1. Implement multipart file upload endpoint with size limits (max 10MB)
2. Create validation for acceptable image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, HEIC)
3. Implement file integrity checks and virus scanning
4. Build error handling for corrupted or invalid images
5. Add upload progress tracking for frontend integration
6. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 2. Develop Image Preprocessing and Optimization Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a service that processes uploaded images to optimize them for storage and delivery while preserving necessary quality
### Details:
1. Implement image resizing to standard resolutions (720p, 480p, thumbnail)
2. Create JPEG compression with configurable quality settings
3. Build EXIF data extraction for metadata (location, timestamp, device info)
4. Implement image format conversion (HEIC to JPEG) when needed
5. Add watermarking capability for copyright protection
6. Create asynchronous processing queue with Spring @Async

## 3. Implement S3 Storage Integration with Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Set up AWS S3 integration for storing both raw and processed images with proper lifecycle policies
### Details:
1. Configure S3 bucket structure with folders for raw and processed images
2. Implement secure upload to S3 with proper credentials management
3. Create lifecycle policies for 90-day retention of raw images
4. Set up versioning for processed images
5. Implement error handling and retry logic for S3 operations
6. Create metadata storage for image references in database

## 4. Build Image Retrieval and Delivery Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create efficient image retrieval system with caching and bandwidth optimization for various network conditions
### Details:
1. Implement CDN integration for faster image delivery
2. Create adaptive image serving based on client device capabilities
3. Build caching layer for frequently accessed images
4. Implement progressive loading for slow connections
5. Create bandwidth detection to serve appropriate image quality
6. Add image preloading for anticipated user navigation paths
