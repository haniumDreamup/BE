# Task ID: 27
# Title: Create Data Analytics and Reporting Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Build analytics platform for guardian insights and system monitoring
# Details:
Implement activity summary generation (daily/weekly/monthly), create health and safety metrics dashboard, develop pattern change detection alerts, implement exportable reports for healthcare providers, add system usage analytics for optimization

# Test Strategy:
Test report generation accuracy, verify data aggregation correctness, test export formats compatibility, validate privacy compliance in reports

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Analytics Data Model and Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive data model for analytics including tables for activity summaries, health metrics, usage patterns, and aggregated statistics with proper indexing for performance
### Details:
Design tables for: daily_activity_summary, weekly_activity_summary, monthly_activity_summary, health_metrics_aggregate, usage_analytics, pattern_detection_results. Include columns for user_id, guardian_id, timestamp, metric_type, metric_value, aggregation_period. Create indexes on user_id, timestamp, and metric_type for fast querying. Use partitioning by date for large tables. Implement data retention policies (e.g., raw data for 3 months, aggregated data for 2 years)

## 2. Implement Activity Summary Generation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Build service to aggregate user activities into daily, weekly, and monthly summaries including medication adherence, location patterns, health metrics, and app usage
### Details:
Create AnalyticsSummaryService with methods: generateDailySummary(), generateWeeklySummary(), generateMonthlySummary(). Implement batch processing using Spring Batch for efficiency. Calculate metrics like: medication adherence rate, average response time to reminders, location visit frequency, health metric trends. Use Redis for caching frequently accessed summaries. Implement scheduled jobs using @Scheduled annotation to run daily at 2 AM, weekly on Sundays, monthly on 1st day

## 3. Develop Health and Safety Metrics Dashboard APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Create REST endpoints for retrieving dashboard data including real-time and historical health metrics, safety indicators, and visual chart data for guardian interface
### Details:
Implement endpoints: GET /api/analytics/dashboard/health-metrics, GET /api/analytics/dashboard/safety-indicators, GET /api/analytics/dashboard/trends/{period}. Return data optimized for chart rendering (time-series format). Include metrics: heart rate trends, blood pressure patterns, fall detection incidents, emergency button usage, medication compliance scores. Implement data aggregation levels (hourly, daily, weekly). Add filters for date range and metric types. Use DTOs like HealthMetricsDashboardResponse, SafetyIndicatorResponse

## 4. Implement Pattern Change Detection and Alert System [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Build intelligent system to detect significant changes in user behavior patterns and generate alerts for guardians including anomaly detection algorithms
### Details:
Create PatternDetectionService using statistical analysis and simple ML algorithms. Implement detection for: sudden medication non-compliance, unusual location patterns, abnormal vital signs, decreased app interaction. Use moving averages and standard deviation for baseline establishment. Set configurable thresholds (e.g., 2 standard deviations). Generate alerts via AlertNotificationService when patterns deviate. Store detection results in pattern_detection_results table. Implement alert severity levels (INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL)

## 5. Create Report Generation and Export Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Build service for generating exportable reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) for healthcare providers and system usage analytics with HIPAA compliance
### Details:
Implement ReportGenerationService with methods: generateHealthcareProviderReport(), generateSystemUsageReport(), generateComplianceReport(). Use Apache POI for Excel generation, iText for PDF creation. Include report templates for: patient summary report, medication adherence report, health metrics trend report, system optimization report. Implement data anonymization for privacy compliance. Add report scheduling and email delivery features. Create endpoints: POST /api/analytics/reports/generate, GET /api/analytics/reports/{reportId}/download
