# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Security Audit Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive security event logging and monitoring system
# Details:
Create security event logging framework, implement failed login attempt tracking, develop data access audit trails, create suspicious activity detection, implement log retention and analysis tools

# Test Strategy:
Test event capture completeness, verify log integrity, test suspicious activity detection accuracy, validate retention policies

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Security Event Logging Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core security event logging infrastructure with standardized event formats and logging interfaces
### Details:
Design SecurityEvent entity with fields for eventType, userId, ipAddress, userAgent, timestamp, severity, and metadata. Create SecurityEventType enum for LOGIN_FAILURE, UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS, DATA_ACCESS, SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY, etc. Implement SecurityEventLogger service with methods for different event types. Define AuditableEvent interface for consistent logging across services. Create custom @SecurityAudit annotation for method-level auditing

## 2. Implement Authentication Event Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Build comprehensive tracking for authentication-related security events including login attempts, failures, and suspicious patterns
### Details:
Extend JwtAuthenticationFilter to log authentication attempts. Create AuthenticationEventListener implementing ApplicationListener<AbstractAuthenticationEvent>. Track failed login attempts with rate limiting (5 failures = 15 min lockout). Implement IP-based tracking for geographic anomaly detection. Store authentication events with device fingerprinting. Create scheduled job to analyze patterns and detect brute force attempts

## 3. Create Data Access Audit System [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive auditing for sensitive data access including medical records, personal information, and guardian access
### Details:
Create JPA EntityListener for tracking CRUD operations on sensitive entities (User, MedicationAdherence, HealthMetric). Implement @AuditSensitiveData annotation for method-level tracking. Log data access with context (who, what, when, why). Track bulk data exports and API calls accessing multiple records. Implement row-level security audit for guardian access to user data. Create audit trail that cannot be modified or deleted

## 4. Develop Anomaly Detection Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2, 37.3
### Description: Build intelligent suspicious activity detection using pattern analysis and machine learning techniques
### Details:
Create AnomalyDetectionService with rule-based detection for immediate threats (rapid API calls, unusual access patterns, privilege escalation attempts). Implement time-series analysis for user behavior baselines. Track unusual data access patterns (accessing many users, odd hours, new locations). Create alert thresholds configurable per user cognitive level. Implement real-time alerting via WebSocket for critical events. Add ML model integration points for future enhancement

## 5. Implement Log Management and Analysis Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2, 37.3, 37.4
### Description: Create comprehensive log retention, archival, and analysis capabilities with compliance considerations
### Details:
Implement log rotation with 90-day hot storage in database, archive to S3 for long-term retention. Create SecurityAuditController with endpoints for log search, filtering, and export. Build dashboard APIs for security metrics (failed logins, suspicious activities, data access patterns). Implement log integrity verification using checksums. Create scheduled reports for compliance requirements. Add data anonymization for logs older than 30 days while maintaining audit trail integrity
