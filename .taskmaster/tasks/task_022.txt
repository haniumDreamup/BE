# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement YOLOv8 Object Detection Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate YOLOv8 for real-time object recognition from wearable camera
# Details:
Set up YOLOv8 model server with optimized inference, implement object detection API endpoint, create object-to-context mapping for relevant items (medicine bottles, signs, hazards), optimize model for edge deployment, implement result caching for common objects

# Test Strategy:
Test detection accuracy for relevant object classes, measure inference time < 500ms, test edge deployment performance, validate object relevance filtering

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up YOLOv8 Model Server Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and deploy YOLOv8 model server with Spring Boot integration, including model loading, initialization, and health monitoring endpoints
### Details:
Create YoloModelService class to manage model lifecycle, implement model loading from S3 bucket or local storage, configure model server with appropriate memory allocation (4GB recommended), set up health check endpoint at /api/v1/ai/yolo/health, implement model warm-up on startup to reduce first inference latency, use @PostConstruct for initialization and @PreDestroy for cleanup

## 2. Create Object Detection API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Implement REST API endpoint for processing images from wearable camera and returning detected objects with confidence scores and bounding boxes
### Details:
Create ObjectDetectionController with POST /api/v1/ai/detect endpoint accepting multipart image upload, implement request validation for image size (max 5MB) and format (JPEG/PNG), create DetectionRequest and DetectionResponse DTOs with proper validation annotations, implement async processing using @Async for better throughput, add request rate limiting (10 requests per minute per user), return standardized response with detected objects array containing class, confidence, and normalized bounding box coordinates

## 3. Implement Object-to-Context Mapping Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Create mapping service to translate detected objects into contextually relevant information for BIF users, focusing on medicine bottles, signs, and hazards
### Details:
Create ContextMappingService with object classification rules, implement ObjectContext enum with categories (MEDICINE, SIGN, HAZARD, DAILY_ITEM), create mapping configuration in application.yml for object class to context mapping, implement relevance scoring algorithm based on user's profile and current activity, add Korean language support for object descriptions using message properties, implement special handling for medicine bottles with OCR integration preparation

## 4. Optimize Model for Edge Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Implement model optimization techniques to achieve sub-500ms inference time suitable for edge devices and real-time processing
### Details:
Implement model quantization using INT8 precision to reduce model size by 75%, create model variants for different device capabilities (high/medium/low), implement dynamic batch sizing based on device performance metrics, add model pruning configuration to remove unnecessary layers, implement TensorRT optimization for NVIDIA edge devices if available, create performance monitoring with Micrometer metrics for inference time tracking

## 5. Implement Result Caching with Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.4
### Description: Create intelligent caching system for common object detection results to reduce computational load and improve response times
### Details:
Implement Redis-based caching using Spring Cache abstraction with @Cacheable annotations, create image hash generation using perceptual hashing for cache key generation, implement cache TTL of 1 hour for detection results with LRU eviction policy, add cache warming for common objects (medicine bottles, common signs), implement cache statistics tracking for hit/miss rates, create cache invalidation API for admin use, integrate with existing RedisCacheService
