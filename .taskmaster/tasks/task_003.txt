# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Authentication and Authorization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement JWT-based authentication with role-based access control supporting User, Guardian, and Admin roles with Spring Security
# Details:
1. Configure Spring Security with JWT token support
2. Implement custom UserDetailsService for BIF user profiles
3. Create JWT token generation and validation utilities
4. Setup role hierarchy: ADMIN > GUARDIAN > USER
5. Implement authentication endpoints:
   - /api/v1/auth/register with cognitive profile
   - /api/v1/auth/login with multi-factor option
   - /api/v1/auth/refresh for token renewal
6. Create authorization annotations for method-level security
7. Implement Guardian-User relationship verification
8. Setup CORS configuration for mobile app
9. Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
10. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
11. Create password reset flow with temporary tokens
12. Add OAuth2 support for future social login

# Test Strategy:
1. Test JWT token generation and validation
2. Verify role-based endpoint access
3. Test Guardian access to user data
4. Security penetration tests for common vulnerabilities
5. Load test authentication endpoints
6. Test token expiration and refresh flows
