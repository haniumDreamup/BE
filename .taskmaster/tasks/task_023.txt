# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop MediaPipe Pose Fall Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement fall detection using MediaPipe pose estimation
# Details:
Integrate MediaPipe Pose model for body keypoint detection, implement fall detection algorithm based on pose changes and acceleration, create confidence scoring for fall events, develop false positive reduction techniques, implement immediate alert triggering for confirmed falls

# Test Strategy:
Test fall detection sensitivity and specificity, measure detection latency < 1 second, test various fall scenarios, validate false positive rate < 5%

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up MediaPipe Pose integration and configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate MediaPipe Pose library into the Spring Boot backend, configure pose detection parameters, and create service wrapper for pose estimation functionality
### Details:
Add MediaPipe Java dependencies to build.gradle, create MediaPipeService class with initialization logic, configure pose detection parameters (min_detection_confidence: 0.5, min_tracking_confidence: 0.5), implement pose landmark extraction methods, create DTOs for pose keypoints (33 body landmarks), ensure proper resource management for MediaPipe graph lifecycle

## 2. Implement pose-based fall detection algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop the core fall detection algorithm using body keypoint positions and angles to identify fall patterns
### Details:
Create FallDetectionAlgorithm class implementing angle calculations between key body segments (hip-shoulder angle, knee-hip angle), detect sudden vertical position changes of hip and shoulder keypoints, implement velocity calculation for keypoint movements, define fall pattern thresholds (angle change > 45 degrees in < 0.5 seconds, vertical displacement > 0.5 meters), create fall state machine (standing -> falling -> fallen), use sliding window approach for temporal analysis

## 3. Develop confidence scoring and validation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create a multi-factor confidence scoring system to validate detected falls and reduce false positives
### Details:
Implement ConfidenceScorer class with weighted scoring factors: pose detection confidence (20%), angle change severity (30%), velocity magnitude (25%), body orientation consistency (25%), create temporal validation requiring consistent fall detection over 3+ consecutive frames, implement pose quality checks (visibility of critical keypoints > 0.7), add environmental context validation (expected activity zones), create confidence threshold system (low: 60-75%, medium: 75-90%, high: >90%)

## 4. Implement false positive reduction techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Develop advanced filtering mechanisms to minimize false alarms from activities like sitting, lying down, or exercising
### Details:
Create ActivityClassifier to distinguish falls from intentional movements (sitting, lying, squatting), implement motion smoothness analysis (falls have abrupt acceleration changes), add recovery detection (person getting up within 10 seconds indicates non-emergency), create user-specific calibration for normal movement patterns, implement context-aware filtering based on location (bed area vs hallway), add pose sequence validation to filter impossible transitions

## 5. Create real-time alert triggering system [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Implement immediate emergency alert system for confirmed fall events with integration to emergency contacts and services
### Details:
Create FallAlertService with real-time event processing, implement alert trigger with grace period (5 seconds for user to cancel false alarm), integrate with EmergencyDetectionService for notification dispatch, add alert payload with fall details (timestamp, location, confidence score, pose snapshot), implement alert escalation (user app -> guardian -> emergency services), create audit logging for all fall events and alerts, ensure sub-second latency from detection to alert initiation
