# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Redis Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Redis for caching frequently accessed data and reducing latency
# Details:
Configure Redis cluster for high availability, implement caching for user profiles and preferences, cache AI model responses for common scenarios, create cache warming strategies for critical data, implement cache invalidation policies

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit rates > 80%, verify cache invalidation correctness, test failover scenarios, measure latency improvements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Redis Infrastructure and Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Redis server configuration with cluster mode for high availability and establish Spring Boot connection
### Details:
Install Redis 7.0+ and configure redis.conf for cluster mode with 3 master nodes and 3 replicas. Set up Redis Sentinel for automatic failover. Configure Spring Boot with Lettuce client in RedisConfig.java, implement connection pooling with max 50 connections, and add health check endpoints. Configure persistence with AOF and RDB snapshots. Set memory policy to allkeys-lru with 4GB max memory per node.

## 2. Implement Cache Service and Annotations [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create generic caching service with Spring Cache abstraction and custom annotations for BIF-specific caching needs
### Details:
Create RedisCacheService implementing cache operations with TTL management. Implement @BifCacheable annotation with configurable TTL and key generation strategies. Create CacheKeyGenerator for consistent key patterns like 'bif:user:{userId}:profile'. Implement cache statistics collection for monitoring hit/miss rates. Add distributed locking with Redisson for cache stampede prevention. Configure Jackson serialization for complex objects.

## 3. Cache User Profiles and Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Implement caching layer for frequently accessed user data including profiles, preferences, and guardian relationships
### Details:
Add @BifCacheable to UserService.findById() with 1-hour TTL. Cache UserPreference entities with 2-hour TTL. Implement batch caching for guardian relationships. Create UserCacheWarmer scheduled job to preload active users at startup. Add cache-aside pattern for user updates with immediate invalidation. Store simplified UserCacheDTO to minimize memory usage.

## 4. Cache AI Model Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Implement intelligent caching for AI model responses based on input similarity and context patterns
### Details:
Create AiResponseCache with similarity-based key generation using input embeddings. Implement 24-hour TTL for object detection results of common items. Cache situational analysis responses for recurring scenarios with 6-hour TTL. Add confidence threshold filtering - only cache responses > 0.8 confidence. Implement cache versioning for model updates. Create background job to analyze and cache top 100 common scenarios.

## 5. Implement Cache Invalidation and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.4
### Description: Create comprehensive cache invalidation strategies and monitoring dashboard for cache performance
### Details:
Implement event-driven invalidation using Spring ApplicationEvents for user updates. Create CacheInvalidationService with pattern-based eviction for related data. Add TTL-based invalidation with staggered expiration to prevent thundering herd. Implement cache metrics endpoint exposing hit/miss rates, memory usage, and latency improvements. Create Grafana dashboard for real-time cache monitoring. Add cache warming strategies for peak hours based on usage patterns.
