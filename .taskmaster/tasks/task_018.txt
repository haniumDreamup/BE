# Task ID: 18
# Title: Build Medication Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive medication tracking and reminder system
# Details:
Create medication schedule database model, implement reminder generation based on prescriptions, develop adherence tracking with photo verification option, create simple visual medication guides, implement guardian alerts for missed medications

# Test Strategy:
Test reminder accuracy and timing, verify photo upload and storage, test adherence calculation algorithms, validate guardian notification triggers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Medication Database Schema and Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database models for medication management including medications, schedules, prescriptions, and adherence tracking
### Details:
Create JPA entities for Medication (id, name, dosage, form, instructions, sideEffects), MedicationSchedule (id, medicationId, userId, frequency, times, startDate, endDate), Prescription (id, medicationId, userId, doctorName, prescribedDate, notes), and MedicationAdherence (id, scheduleId, scheduledTime, takenTime, status, photoUrl). Add proper relationships using @ManyToOne and @OneToMany annotations. Include validation constraints and indexes for performance optimization.

## 2. Implement Medication Service and Reminder Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop core medication management service with automated reminder generation based on prescription schedules
### Details:
Create MedicationService with methods for CRUD operations on medications and prescriptions. Implement MedicationScheduleService with reminder generation logic that creates reminders based on frequency (daily, twice-daily, weekly) and specified times. Use Spring Scheduler with @Scheduled annotation to run reminder generation every hour. Store generated reminders in Redis with TTL for quick access. Include timezone handling for accurate reminder times.

## 3. Build Adherence Tracking with Photo Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement medication adherence tracking system with optional photo upload for verification
### Details:
Create AdherenceService to track medication taking events. Implement photo upload endpoint that accepts multipart files, validates image format/size, and stores in AWS S3. Generate presigned URLs for secure photo access. Create adherence calculation algorithms (daily, weekly, monthly adherence rates). Implement AdherenceController with endpoints: POST /medications/adherence/{scheduleId}/confirm (with optional photo), GET /medications/adherence/stats/{userId}. Add photo metadata storage including timestamp and geolocation if available.

## 4. Create Visual Medication Guides and Simplified UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop visual medication guide system with simple, accessible medication information display
### Details:
Create MedicationGuideService to generate visual guides including pill images, dosage visualizations, and simple instructions. Implement medication image mapping system using external pill image API or local database. Create DTOs for simplified medication display with 5th-grade reading level descriptions. Build REST endpoints: GET /medications/{id}/guide (returns visual guide data), GET /medications/visual-search (search by color/shape). Include icon-based time representations (sun for morning, moon for night) and color-coding for medication types.

## 5. Implement Guardian Alert System for Missed Medications [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Build notification system to alert guardians when medications are missed, with configurable thresholds
### Details:
Create GuardianAlertService that monitors adherence data and triggers alerts based on configurable rules. Implement alert thresholds (immediate for critical meds, after 2 hours for regular). Build notification queue using Redis to prevent duplicate alerts. Create AlertController with endpoints: POST /medications/alerts/configure (set guardian preferences), GET /medications/alerts/history. Implement multiple notification channels (push, SMS, email) with fallback mechanism. Add alert acknowledgment system to prevent notification spam.
