# Task ID: 26
# Title: Develop OCR Service for Text Recognition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate Google Vision API for reading signs and text in user environment
# Details:
Set up Google Vision API client, implement text extraction from camera images, create text simplification service for complex words, develop contextual text interpretation (medicine labels, signs), implement language translation if needed

# Test Strategy:
Test OCR accuracy in various lighting conditions, verify text simplification effectiveness, test real-time performance, validate API error handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Google Vision API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Google Cloud project and integrate Google Vision API client into the Spring Boot application
### Details:
Create Google Cloud project, enable Vision API, generate service account credentials, add google-cloud-vision dependency to build.gradle, configure API credentials in application properties, create VisionApiConfig class with @Configuration annotation to initialize ImageAnnotatorClient bean, implement proper error handling for API initialization failures

## 2. Implement Image Processing and Text Detection Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Create service to process images from camera and extract text using Google Vision OCR
### Details:
Create OcrService with methods for image preprocessing (format conversion, quality enhancement), implement detectText method using Vision API's TEXT_DETECTION feature, handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG), implement batch processing for multiple text regions, create DTOs for OCR results including confidence scores and bounding boxes, implement caching for repeated text detection requests using Redis

## 3. Develop Text Simplification and Analysis Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Create service to simplify complex text and provide user-friendly explanations suitable for target users
### Details:
Implement TextSimplificationService with word complexity analysis using readability metrics, integrate dictionary API for word definitions, create simplified vocabulary mapping for common complex terms, implement sentence restructuring for long/complex sentences, develop domain-specific simplification rules for medicine labels and warning signs, use Korean language processing libraries for proper text handling

## 4. Create Contextual Interpretation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Develop service to interpret detected text based on context and provide actionable guidance
### Details:
Implement ContextualInterpretationService with pattern matching for different text types (medicine instructions, warning signs, store names), create interpretation rules for common scenarios, integrate with user's medication data for personalized medicine label interpretation, implement safety warnings for hazardous text content, develop location-aware interpretation using device GPS, create user-friendly action suggestions based on detected text

## 5. Implement OCR Controller and Response Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.2, 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Create REST API endpoints for OCR functionality with proper error handling and user-friendly responses
### Details:
Create OcrController with POST endpoint /api/ocr/analyze accepting multipart image uploads, implement request validation for image size and format, create comprehensive OcrResponse DTO with original text, simplified text, interpretation, and action suggestions, implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages for API failures, add request rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion, implement async processing for large images with webhook callbacks
