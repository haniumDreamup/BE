# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create Navigation Assistance API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build navigation system optimized for cognitive accessibility
# Details:
Integrate with mapping services for route calculation, implement landmark-based navigation instructions, create simplified turn-by-turn directions using familiar references, add public transportation guidance with step-by-step instructions, implement route complexity scoring for BIF users

# Test Strategy:
Test route simplification algorithms, verify landmark recognition accuracy, test public transport instructions clarity, validate complexity scoring accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up mapping service integration and route calculation foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate with Google Maps API or similar mapping service to enable basic route calculation functionality and establish the foundation for navigation features
### Details:
Create MapService interface and implementation using Google Maps Directions API. Configure API keys in application properties. Implement basic route request/response DTOs with fields for origin, destination, waypoints, and route preferences. Create service methods for calculating routes between two points with support for different travel modes (walking, public transit). Implement caching layer using Redis to store frequently requested routes. Add configuration for API rate limiting and error handling.

## 2. Implement landmark-based navigation instruction generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create system to identify landmarks along routes and generate navigation instructions using familiar reference points instead of complex street names
### Details:
Create LandmarkService to identify notable landmarks near route waypoints using Places API. Build landmark database with common reference points (stores, hospitals, schools). Implement NavigationInstructionGenerator that converts turn-by-turn directions into landmark-based instructions. Create algorithm to select most recognizable landmarks based on prominence scores. Develop instruction templates using simple Korean language patterns. Store user-specific familiar landmarks in database for personalized navigation.

## 3. Build public transportation guidance system [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive public transit navigation with step-by-step instructions optimized for BIF users, including bus/subway guidance with visual cues
### Details:
Create PublicTransitService integrating with transit APIs for real-time schedules. Implement TransitInstructionBuilder generating step-by-step guidance for bus/subway trips. Add visual instruction components (colors, numbers, symbols) for easier recognition. Create transfer guidance with timing buffers for BIF users. Implement station/stop identification using landmarks and visual markers. Add real-time alerts for approaching stops with multiple notification methods.

## 4. Develop route complexity scoring algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Create intelligent scoring system to evaluate route complexity for BIF users and suggest simpler alternatives when available
### Details:
Design ComplexityScorer analyzing factors: number of turns, transfers, walking distance, traffic complexity, time pressure. Implement weighted scoring algorithm with configurable parameters. Create route simplification engine suggesting alternatives with lower complexity scores. Add user preference learning to adjust scoring based on individual capabilities. Implement complexity visualization for guardians to review routes. Store complexity scores with routes for performance optimization.

## 5. Create Navigation API endpoints and integration layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Build RESTful API endpoints for navigation features with proper authentication, error handling, and BIF-optimized responses
### Details:
Create NavigationController with endpoints: POST /api/navigation/route (calculate route), GET /api/navigation/instructions/{routeId} (get instructions), POST /api/navigation/simplify (get simpler alternatives), GET /api/navigation/landmarks/nearby (get nearby landmarks). Implement request/response DTOs with validation. Add authentication and guardian access controls. Create simplified error responses with user-friendly Korean messages. Implement response caching and compression. Add usage analytics for route requests.
