# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create automated deployment pipeline with quality gates
# Details:
Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD, implement automated testing in pipeline, create Docker containerization for all services, set up blue-green deployment strategy, implement automated rollback mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
Test pipeline execution time < 15 minutes, verify deployment rollback functionality, test quality gate effectiveness, validate zero-downtime deployment

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup GitHub Actions Workflow Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational GitHub Actions workflow files with proper job definitions for CI/CD pipeline
### Details:
Create .github/workflows directory structure. Define main workflow file (main.yml) with separate jobs for build, test, and deploy stages. Configure workflow triggers for push to main/develop branches and pull requests. Set up environment variables and secrets management. Define job dependencies and conditional execution based on branch patterns.

## 2. Implement Automated Testing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Configure comprehensive automated testing within GitHub Actions including unit, integration, and quality checks
### Details:
Add Gradle test execution steps with proper test reporting. Configure JaCoCo for code coverage with 80% threshold enforcement. Implement SonarQube integration for code quality analysis. Add database migration validation using Flyway. Configure parallel test execution for performance. Generate and archive test reports as artifacts.

## 3. Create Docker Containerization [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Dockerize the Spring Boot application and configure multi-stage builds for optimized images
### Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfile with separate build and runtime stages. Optimize JVM settings for container environment. Configure health checks and graceful shutdown. Create docker-compose files for local development and testing. Implement container scanning for security vulnerabilities. Set up Docker image versioning strategy aligned with Git tags.

## 4. Configure Blue-Green Deployment Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.3
### Description: Implement zero-downtime blue-green deployment mechanism for AWS infrastructure
### Details:
Create deployment scripts for AWS ECS/EC2 blue-green deployment. Configure Application Load Balancer for traffic switching. Implement health check validation before traffic cutover. Create deployment configuration with rollback triggers. Set up CloudWatch monitoring for deployment metrics. Configure deployment notifications via SNS.

## 5. Implement Automated Rollback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Create automated rollback system with monitoring-based triggers and manual override capabilities
### Details:
Implement CloudWatch alarms for key metrics (error rate, response time, memory usage). Configure automatic rollback triggers based on alarm thresholds. Create rollback workflow in GitHub Actions with version selection. Implement database migration rollback handling. Add deployment history tracking and rollback audit logs. Create manual rollback approval process for critical situations.
