# Task ID: 36
# Title: Develop Performance Optimization Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28, 30
# Priority: low
# Description: Create system for monitoring and optimizing application performance
# Details:
Implement query optimization monitoring, create automatic index recommendations, develop API response time tracking, implement resource usage optimization, create performance baseline establishment

# Test Strategy:
Test optimization recommendation accuracy, verify performance improvements, test resource usage reduction, validate baseline accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Query Performance Monitoring Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database query monitoring system to track execution times, resource usage, and query patterns
### Details:
Implement QueryPerformanceInterceptor to capture all SQL queries with execution metrics. Create QueryStats entity to store query hash, execution time, row count, and timestamp. Develop QueryPerformanceRepository for storing and analyzing query metrics. Implement real-time query monitoring using Spring AOP to intercept all repository method calls. Add configurable thresholds for slow query detection (default >500ms). Create query fingerprinting to group similar queries together for pattern analysis.

## 2. Create Automatic Index Recommendation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Develop intelligent system to analyze query patterns and recommend database index optimizations
### Details:
Build IndexRecommendationService that analyzes collected query metrics to identify missing indexes. Implement algorithm to detect frequent table scans, sort operations, and join patterns. Create index impact analyzer to estimate performance improvements. Develop recommendation scoring based on query frequency, execution time impact, and index maintenance cost. Generate CREATE INDEX statements with proper column ordering. Implement duplicate index detection to avoid redundant recommendations. Add support for composite indexes based on query WHERE and JOIN clauses.

## 3. Develop API Response Time Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive API performance monitoring with endpoint-level metrics and alerting
### Details:
Create ResponseTimeInterceptor using HandlerInterceptor to track all API requests. Implement ApiMetrics entity to store endpoint, method, response time, status code, and request size. Develop real-time metrics aggregation using Redis for sub-second performance tracking. Create percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99) for each endpoint. Implement automatic alerting when response times exceed SLA thresholds. Add request correlation tracking for distributed tracing. Create performance dashboard endpoints for monitoring tools integration.

## 4. Implement Resource Usage Optimization Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.3
### Description: Create service to monitor and optimize CPU, memory, database connections, and cache usage
### Details:
Develop ResourceMonitorService using JMX and Micrometer for comprehensive metrics collection. Implement connection pool optimization based on usage patterns using HikariCP metrics. Create memory usage analyzer to detect leaks and optimize heap allocation. Develop cache hit ratio optimizer for Redis using usage statistics. Implement automatic garbage collection tuning recommendations. Create resource usage baseline profiler that runs during low-traffic periods. Add predictive scaling recommendations based on historical patterns.

## 5. Create Performance Baseline and Anomaly Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.2, 36.3, 36.4
### Description: Establish performance baselines and detect anomalies in system behavior
### Details:
Build PerformanceBaselineService to establish normal performance patterns for all metrics. Implement statistical baseline calculation using moving averages and standard deviations over 7-day windows. Create anomaly detection using z-score analysis for sudden performance degradations. Develop trend analysis to identify gradual performance deterioration. Implement automatic baseline updates during maintenance windows. Create performance regression detection for new deployments. Generate comprehensive performance reports with optimization recommendations ranked by impact.
