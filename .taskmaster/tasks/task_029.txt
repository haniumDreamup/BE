# Task ID: 29
# Title: Develop Offline Mode Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement offline functionality for critical features
# Details:
Create local data synchronization framework, implement offline medication reminders, develop offline emergency contact access, create location tracking queue for later upload, implement conflict resolution for data sync

# Test Strategy:
Test offline feature availability, verify data synchronization integrity, test conflict resolution scenarios, validate queue persistence

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Local Storage Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust local storage system using SQLite for offline data persistence with proper schema design and migration support
### Details:
Set up SQLite database with Room persistence library for Android or Core Data for iOS. Design schema to mirror critical server-side tables (medications, reminders, emergency contacts, user preferences). Implement database versioning and migration strategies. Create data access objects (DAOs) for CRUD operations. Add encryption for sensitive data using SQLCipher. Implement storage size monitoring to prevent device storage overflow.

## 2. Build Data Synchronization Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop a bidirectional sync engine that tracks changes, queues updates, and handles data synchronization when connectivity is restored
### Details:
Implement change tracking using timestamps and sync flags on all offline-capable entities. Create a sync queue table to store pending operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE). Develop sync status tracking with retry logic and exponential backoff. Build sync adapters for each data type with transformation logic. Implement batch sync operations to minimize API calls. Add sync progress indicators and status callbacks for UI updates.

## 3. Implement Offline Medication Reminder System [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Create a self-contained medication reminder system that functions without server connectivity using local notifications and cached data
### Details:
Cache medication schedules and reminder configurations locally. Implement local notification scheduling using AlarmManager (Android) or UNNotificationCenter (iOS). Create reminder generation logic that runs entirely offline. Store reminder acknowledgments locally for later sync. Implement smart pre-caching of reminder content including medication images and instructions. Add fallback reminder sounds and vibration patterns for offline mode.

## 4. Develop Offline Emergency Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Build emergency contact access and location tracking capabilities that function in offline mode with queued uploads
### Details:
Cache emergency contact information with encrypted storage. Implement offline emergency button functionality with local alert generation. Create location tracking service that stores GPS coordinates locally when offline. Build upload queue for location data with automatic submission when online. Implement offline fall detection data storage. Add SMS fallback for emergency notifications when data connection is unavailable.

## 5. Create Conflict Resolution and Data Merge System [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Implement intelligent conflict resolution strategies for handling data discrepancies between local and server versions during synchronization
### Details:
Develop conflict detection algorithm comparing local and server timestamps. Implement resolution strategies: last-write-wins for preferences, server-priority for medications, merge for activity logs. Create conflict resolution UI for user intervention when needed. Build data validation to ensure consistency post-merge. Implement rollback mechanism for failed sync operations. Add comprehensive logging for sync conflicts and resolutions.
