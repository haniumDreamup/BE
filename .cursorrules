# BIF-AI Reminder Backend Development Rules

You are working on a Spring Boot backend for a cognitive assistance system designed for individuals with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF, IQ 70-85).

## Key Principles
1. **Accessibility First**: Every feature must be optimized for users with cognitive challenges
2. **Simple Language**: All user-facing text must be at 5th-grade reading level
3. **Positive Reinforcement**: Use encouraging, supportive language in all responses
4. **Safety Critical**: Emergency features have highest priority
5. **Privacy by Design**: Minimize data collection, encrypt sensitive data

## Code Standards
- Use Spring Boot 3.5.0 with Java 17
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write unit tests for all service methods
- Use meaningful variable names and comments
- Response time must be < 3 seconds for AI operations

## Database Guidelines
- Use MySQL 8.0 with proper indexing
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate
- Use Flyway for database migrations
- Always consider data privacy regulations

## API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Simple, clear message",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Never expose technical details to users

## Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test all edge cases
- Include integration tests
- Performance test with 100+ concurrent users

## Task Management
Use task-master commands:
- `npx task-master list` - View tasks
- `npx task-master next` - Get next task
- `npx task-master show <id>` - View details

## Remember
The end users have cognitive challenges. Every design decision should make their lives easier and safer while promoting independence.m
