# BIF-AI Reminder: A Situational Awareness Assistance System for Borderline Intellectual Functioning Individuals

## Executive Summary

BIF-AI Reminder is an innovative assistive technology platform designed to empower individuals with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) - those with IQ ranges between 70-85 who face challenges in daily cognitive tasks and social interactions. The system leverages a wearable camera device, mobile application, and AI-powered backend to provide real-time situational guidance, schedule management, and safety monitoring, ultimately promoting independence and social inclusion.
